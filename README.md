# ascii-reader

As a user, I'd like to see a welcome message (so that I feel, y'know, welcome).
As a user, I'd like to view a list of ASCII artworks that can be displayed so that I can make my choice.
As a user, when I enter the number next to an artwork in the list, the artwork will be displayed (so that I can see it!)
